Software to provide manual control to a Canon 244T.

THE 300V CAPS MUST BE COMPLETELY DISCHARGED BEFORE ANY WORK ON THE
FLASH.  The caps retain lethal voltage indefinitely after the flash is
powered off.

The 244T measures the resistance of a photodiode between 5.5V &
photodiode 0V to determine the amount of power.  This program merely
provides an adjustible resistor to replace the photodiode.  The
resistance is logarithmic & set with up & down buttons.  A junk LED
readout shows 0-10 for the value.

flash_pot.pcb: circuit board using a junk LED readout.  Read with the
pcb program: http://pcb.geda-project.org/  It connects to the following
flash pads:

    BOARD -> FLASH
    6V -> 5.5V
    RESISTOR W -> PHOTODIODE 0V
    GND -> BATT GND
    The crystal can be any frequency down to 32khz.

The photodiode must be disconnected from photodiode 0-5.5V & photodiode
0V.


usb_programmer.c: a junk PIC programmer.  The hex file is programmable
with a pickit for mortals but pickit users must create an mplab project
to write the special function registers & hex file.

flash_pot.s: the PIC firmware.  Requires gpasm to compile.

Convert a wired Canon ETTL flash to wireless.

A camera module emulates a flash connected to the camera.  A flash
module emulates a camera connected to the flash.  This required a 168Mhz
processor to bit bang fast enough, though the flash side might be doable
with something slower.

This requires stm32stuff to be in the parent directory.  Compile with
make wireless.bin.  Install with ../stm32stuff/uart_programmer wireless.bin

Tap the button to blink the current channel.  Hold the button to cycle
through the channels.

Enable SIM_CAM to compile the flash firmware.
Enable SIM_FLASH to compile the camera firmware.

Disable ENABLE_PRINT in the Makefile to increase robustness.

TODO: camera board should be sandwiched between the switches & hot
shoe.  This emerged as a more convenient arrangement.
